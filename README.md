# 🍎 Food finder

### 📍 Purpose
This app aims to make it quick and easy to see the macro-nutrients for food. The long-term goal is that this application would also have the ability to help calculate nutrients based on your input, and create meal plans with this information. 

### 🧩 How to use
At the moment, the app is fairly self-explanatory. You have the homepage and the browse page. You search for foods on the browse page and, if it exists on the list, it will pull up a card with the macro-nutrients on it.

### ‼️ Note
Currently, this app only has a very finite number of foods available. Common food such as apples, bananas, and peanuts are included. Other foods that may be more obscure like squash, okra, or sauces are not yet available.
It will be progressively added to and updated over time. Eventually the user will be able to see the micro-nutrients in addition to the macro-nutrients. Moreover, the user will be able to create meal plans and see the spread of nutrients for those plans.
